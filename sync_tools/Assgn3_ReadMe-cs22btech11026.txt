Execution Instructions:
1)Compile the source file by running "g++ filename" 
2)Run the executable file by running "./a.out"

Input Format:
1)Input should be in a file named "input.txt" in the same directory as "a.out".
2)Input format is same as given in problem statement(N K rowInc Matrix)

Output Format:
1)Output file is produced after running the executable
2)Output file name is specified above
3)The first line of output contains time taken

Note:
For experiments I only took n upto 2048 because after that it is taking too long.
